Producer-Consumer Problem

If you have a bounded buffer you must wait until a buffer is free to place a process


Interprocess communication (IPC)

Needed for sending messages between processes via shared memory or a bus
Use a queue to handle sending and receiving

In direct messaging a link is established between processes and there are methods to read or receive messages
In indirect messaging messages are sent to a port which can be read by the other process

Send/receiving can be blocking or non-blocking

With no buffer message must be received immediately
With bounded capacity senders wait when the buffer is full
Unlimited buffer means no wait, it is highly realistic and often constructed using infinite size hard drives

Remote Procedure Call (RPC)

RPC is a way to communicate between processes on multiple machines
Sockets (Network)
Java has has a unique system, Remote Method Invocation (RMI) which does the same thing as RPC

Multithreading

Many-to-One - Many user threads handled by one kernel thread
One-to-One - Each user thread has a kernel thread
Many-to-Many - Many user threads handled by many kernel threads
