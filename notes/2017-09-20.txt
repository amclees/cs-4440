Scheduling of Processes

Switching between processes takes time
Thus, there are a number of criteria for scheduling processes
Max ->  CPU Utilization
Max ->  Throughput
Min ->  Turnaround time
Min ->  Waiting time
Min ->  Response time

Scheduling types:
  FCFS (First come first serve)
    More intensive processes make the others wait a long time
  SJF (Shortest job first)
    Is optimal, gives minimum average waiting time
    If it is preemptive, processes can have their resources taken away while running

0
2
7
11

11 + 7 + 2 / 4 = 20 / 4 = 5
Could be 8

This example is FCFS. A queue can be used to implement it.
