Beginning of class from now on will have a quiz to encourage attendance.

Processes

Batch system jobs - downloading a file
Time-shared systems - user programs

A process is a program in execution
It must execute in order
It has a program counter, stack, and data section.

Program counter tracks the address of the running instruction.
The stack tracks calls and keeps local data
Heap keeps other data
By "text", we mean the program

Process's state goes from new to ready to running to waiting and eventually is terminated.

Process Control Block (PCB)

The PCB holds information related to each process:
State
Program counter
CPU regosters
CPU scheduling information
Memory management information
Accounting information
IO status information

PCB is stored in memory
The CPU switches between multiple processes by storing the PCB in main memory and loading another PCB


Long term scheduler schedules jobs into ready queue
Short term scheduler schedules which process should be executed next

2 types of process:
IO-bound processes spend more time doing IO, only uses short CPU bursts
CPU-bound processes uses a lot of CPU time

In Solaris, there is a tree of processes; each process has children

Parent and child processes may run concurrently or sequentially, and may share all, a subset of, or no resources

Bring laptop next time

Next time is quiz, covering chapter 1 and chapter 2
Quiz is simple, it will be multiple choice
Not open notes
No class Monday
