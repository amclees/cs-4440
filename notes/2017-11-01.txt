Deadlock Prevention Continued

Recovery from deadlock is also important
  Abort all deadlocked processes
  Abort processes one by one until there is no longer deadlock
    Choosing the order depends on a variety of factors relating to the importance of the process

Deadlock finished


Main Memory

Protection of memory is a requirement of any OS

There is a logical address, and a physical address
The logical address is the way the CPU views the memory
These addresses are the same in compile-time and load-time binding schemes but can be different otherwise

The system has a memory-management unit (MMU)
It translates logical addresses to physical addresses

MMU is integrated into the RAM unit

Dynamic linking postpones linking until execution time

Swapping

Processes may be swapped into storage out of memory
If the process is not running it may be swapped out

Swapping is somewhat expensive
