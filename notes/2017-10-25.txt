Deadlock Requirements

Mutual exclusion
Hold and wait
No preemption
Circular wait

All are required for deadlock

P_i is a process
R_i is a resource

A graph may be used to visual transitions between usage state
This can make it easier to identify deadlock

To prevent deadlock
  Mutual exclusion - should only be used on non-shared resources
  Hold and wait - Require process to have resources allocated before running or require it to have no resources before requesting resources
  No preemption - Preempt waiting process
  Circular wait - limit order
