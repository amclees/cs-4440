Main Memory Continued

Exam Wednesday, not online

The OS is usually in the lower addresses

The MMU uses a pair of base and limit registers to determine to range of memory accessible to a user program

Contiguous allocation meaans all processes have one large chunk of memory
  In this scheme the OS needs to track free holes and allocate them
  Find the smallest hole (best fit)

  First-fit
  Best-fit
    Smallest hole
  Worst-fit
    Largest hole
    Worst in terms of performance

Fragmentation
  External
    Memory exists to satisfy a request but is not contiguous
    Cannot always allocate even if there is room
  Internal
    Allocate some extra memory between requested memory
  Need to try to remove fragmentation by compaction
    Moves around memory, and must be done at execution time

Paging
  All modern OSes use paging
  It divides memory into blocks called frames (usually 512 to 8,192 bytes (1k, 2k, 4k are most used))
  Can scatter these pages across memory
  Use a page table to translate logical addresses
  No external fragmentation
  There is internal fragmentation when the inside of a frame is not fully utilized
  Speak in kb not bytes

  The paging in Windows XP is what limits memory to 4 GB

  Address translation schemes depend on the number of bits in addresses used by the CPU
  Paging is also built into hardware

  This is different from contiguous allocation, memory of a single process is spread throughout memory

  Free frames are tracked and reallocated by the OS
